RPGHelper is a simple tool that lets you simplify your board game needs.
 
It helps you organize your heroes and items. It allows for easy communication with other users.
RPGHelper offers even more features so just give it a try and discover that for yourself. :)
 
RPGHelper was made as a team Project for the SoftUni course "Database Advanced With Entity Framework".
